        <h1>Summer Pepper Shakshuka</h1>
        <p>Shakshuka is a popular North African dish featuring poached eggs. Instead of water, the eggs are poached in a flavorful sauce, usually comprised of tomatoes and peppers—both of which are at the height of ripeness in late summer. In this recipe, we’re simmering the vegetables, then poaching the eggs by baking the dish, resulting in the perfect consistency. In step 6, if you don’t have an oven-safe pan, don’t worry! Simply transfer the mixture to a baking dish before cracking the eggs into the sauce. Served with spiced pitas, this beautiful, wholesome meal is an amazingly delicious way to celebrate the closing of the season.</p>

Garnish the baked shakshuka with the remaining parsley. Serve with the toasted pitas on the side. Enjoy!</p>
